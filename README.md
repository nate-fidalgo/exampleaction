# exampleaction
I know this is in the marketplace so please beaware this is just me testing how the who marketplace process goes.
The action is harmless on its own / only echo's input variables as output variables in the console. However used improperly it might beable to compromise secrets in the console.
So dont pass anything sensitive to this action. Its not harmful but passing it sensitive input expose it as sensitive output.
More just testing eventually will delete and only expose worthwhile actions.
